On My website, I did the basics by creating the five webpages and placing the information into them.

then I struggled with the coding and had to get to grips with it for example how to create a background colour or place a heading area to make it visible.

So, I had used the previous topic I which was ottergram and changed it up a bit to suit my webpage.

 In week 1 I created the outline of my website and adding no writing just yet. Also, I had a rough idea of how to website was going to turn out and look and I started to play around with atom to get me set up and get familiar with it.
week two I did most of my website for example adding writings and linking them. I started it doing page by page to get it done without no hassle and I had my writing done in a day. This meant just doing the css but it was easier said than done as I created a different css for each webpage so It could have its own but it was not working as the pages weren’t looking similar. Which meant I had to create one css and do it that so every page looked identical just the way I had wanted it.
In week 3 I only had to link the webpages which were a bit of a struggle at first until the people I collaborated who were Jorem , damian and syllvanus which gave me a better idea about atom and how it operates and gave me the help to get my webpages sorted.
The biggest problem I had faced throughout the process was committing my work as I could understand how to do that and getting to use the command prompt or git.
