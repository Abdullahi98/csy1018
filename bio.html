  <body>
    <p>I am a computing student at the university of northampton currently all aspects of computing and hopefully looking to go into the whole of networking.</p>
    <p>I am originally from somalia fromt the capital city and also I can speak three languages e.g. Somali,English and Arabic. I am from Milton keynes not far from the university.</p>
    <p>In my free time I enjoy playing football with my friends and I am a passionate supporter of Arsenal "come on you gunners." I also enjoy playing other types of sport such as</p>
    <li>basketball</li>
    <li>badminton</li>
    <li>table tennis</li>
    <p>Also in my free time I play with every aspect of computing coming from problem solving using greenfoot and networking by using packet tracer this enables me to get an insight of what people get up to and how they started theur careers from it so it motivates me to try them out and get use to it.</p>
